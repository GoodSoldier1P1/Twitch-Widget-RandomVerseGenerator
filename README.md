A customizable Bible verse widget for StreamElements overlays.
Easily display rotating Scripture verses on your livestream with automatic updates and flexible configuration.

🚀 Setup Guide (StreamElements)
1. Add the Widget to Your Overlay
- Open your StreamElements Dashboard
- Navigate to Streaming Tools → My Overlays
- Select an existing overlay or create a new one
- Click the “+” button
- Choose Static/Custom → Custom Widget

2. Install the Widget Code
- In the popup, click “Open Editor”
- Delete everything currently in the editor
- Copy the entire code from the provided artifact

- Click Save

3. Position the Widget

⚙️ Settings Panel (Under Development)
The settings panel is currently hidden and not functional.
A future update will re‑enable this panel with options such as:
- Selecting verse sources (entire Bible, NT, OT, specific books)
- Adjusting update intervals
- Setting maximum verse length
- Enabling/disabling auto‑update
These features are actively being worked on and will be restored once stable.

📌 Notes
- Once the settings panel is complete, it will appear via a gear icon in the widget’s top‑right corner.
- For now, all widget behavior is controlled internally by the script.
